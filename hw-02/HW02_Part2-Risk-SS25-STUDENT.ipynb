    "In this assignment, we'll explore graphs using the board game Risk as our practical example. Risk is a strategy game played on a world map where territories are connected to their neighbors. This makes it a perfect candidate for graph representation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a graph representation of a real-world game board\n",
    "- practice using networkx\n",
    "- do some research\n",
    "- visualize graph data using NetworkX\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is split into two notebooks:\n",
    "- Notebook 1 of 2 is worth **14 + 33 + 3 = 51 points** \n",
    "- Notebook 2 of 2 is worth **1+ 42 + 1 = 44 points** \n",
    "for a total of **95 points**. Point values for each part are included in the section headers and question prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This assignment is due at 11:59 pm on Friday, March 21st.** It should be uploaded into the \"Homework Assignments\" submission folder for Homework #2 on D2L.  Submission instructions can be found at the end of the notebook. **You must also fill out a survey regarding this assignment.** The link to this survey can also be found at the end of the notebook.\n",
